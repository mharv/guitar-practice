learning the fretboard:
loop through each note randomly, find them starting from:
- 6th string - 1st string and back
- 1st string - 6th string and back
- random string order 
- 1st fret to 12th fret and back - all strings

the above can be used with a slow metronome to force you to think faster

learning triads:
loop through each root note randomly, find them in froups of 3 strings:
- (6th or 1st string) 1st fret to ~15th fret and back, move onto next set of 3 strings
- the reverse to the above.
- across the neck, 1st fret, all 4 groups of 3 strings, up or down, repeat to ~15th fret and return.
- random order of inversions. find each randomly chosen inversion over the neck.

picking exercises:
practice etude or exercise to metronome using variations on picking like:
- up strokes only
- down strokes only
- alternate picking
- up up down down time variations
